The log files from the talk can be produced using the commands found in `./run_z3.sh` (requires z3 to be installed in the path: tested with version 4.8.7 and 4.12.2) and `./run_verus.sh` (you will need to change `./verus.sh` to point to your local build of the Verus executable: tested with the latest version on GitHub at the time of writing).
